# Template LaTeX codes

Templates frequently used by me. This folder is to prevent reinventing the wheel every time I have to write anything in LaTeX.

The templates have an `INFO.md` and not a `README.md` in order to avoid a conflict with a possible readme file in their location of use.

## Contents

Each folder in this repository is a complete LaTeX project. The result is nothing particularly informative, but just a set of files useful in starting projects.

| Folder | Description |
| :--- | :---- |
| [Basic Modular Article](./Basic%20Modular%20Article/INFO.md) | A basic modular article |
| [IIITH Assignments](./IIITH%20Assignments/) | For IIIT Hyderabad assignments |
